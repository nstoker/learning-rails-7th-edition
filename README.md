# README

Following [Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-on-rails-7th-edition-tutorial) - this being the draft 7th Edition.

In addition to the MIT Licence, the tutorial is also covered by the Beerware Licence:

```text
Michael Hartl wrote this code. As long as you retain this notice you can do
whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this
stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
```

The me above means Michael (although if you want to buy me beer too, that works for me).
